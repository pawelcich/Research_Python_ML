    "<h3> Introduction </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The goal of the final project</b> is to predict types of physical activity (e.g., walking, climbing stairs) from tri-axial smartphone accelerometer data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The input data </b> consists of two files. The first file, <code>train_time_series.csv</code>, contains the raw accelerometer data with following format: <code>timestamp, UTC time, accuracy, x, y, z</code>. <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> correspond to measurements of linear acceleration along each of the three orthogonal axes. Another file, <code>train_labels.csv</code>, contains the activity labels. With these labels, one can train the model. Different activities have been numbered with integers: 1 = standing, 2 = walking, 3 = stairs down, 4 = stairs up. The labels in <code>train_labels.csv</code> are only provided for every 10th observation in <code>train_time_series.csv</code>. <code>train_time_series.csv</code> contains about 3750 observations; accordingly, <code>train_labels.csv</code> contains around 375 labels. There is also a file called <code>test_time_series.csv></code> based on which one is asked to provide the activity labels predicted by the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The <b> key steps taken </b> were, first, to map the training labels with the observations. In order not to lose the data in between the provided labels, a rolling window method was used. Next, since the true labels for this test data is not given, my approach was to split the training data once more. This way, different models and paramaters could be tested. Once a reasonably accurate model was found, it was used on the actual test data and the results written to the file <code>test_labels.csv</code>.\n",
    "    \n",
    "As an <b> additional assignment </b>, one was asked to provide the running time of one's code, starting at the moment the test data is loaded and ending when the predictions are computed. Here, the simple approach was to wright the starting and ending time to a variable, respectively, and calculate the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Nota bene:</b> I have a background in the humanities. Working with quantifiable/quantified data is not my area of expertise. I cannot explain some of the problems underlying the assignment beyond what was immediately taught during the course. My solution is based on trial and error as well as skimming through some scientific papers on the subject."

To reduce noise and capture cyclic patterns of motion, features were not computed on each single sample, but on a sliding window of samples.

We experimentally compared window sizes of 1 second, 2 seconds, 5 seconds, and 10 seconds, and found that the 2-second window size (60 samples in our case) produced the best classification performance. --- Wu, Wanmin et al. âClassification accuracies of physical activities using smartphone motion sensors.â Journal of medical Internet research vol. 14,5 e130. 5 Oct. 2012, doi:10.2196/jmir.2208)\n",

    "The assignment was to predict types of physical activity from smartphone accelerometer data. Since the test labels for this classification problem were not provided with the test data and since the results based on Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification scored a rather low accuracy upon first submission, the problem of missing test labels was circumvented by splitting the provided training data further and testing further models. Although it was now possible to measure accuracy, scores were still low. Based on skimming through research papers, an additional approach was adopted, namely increasing the window size of calculating the means of observations. With a significantly bigger window size, the accuracy of Random Forest Classification (among others) scored much higher. This approach was then used on the originally provided test data. The main python techniques were pandas Dataframe objects to store and work on the data as well as methods from the sklearn library to implement machine learning."
